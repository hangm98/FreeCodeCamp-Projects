            Throughout his life, he had worked as a kitchen helper, a pasty chef, a jounarlist, a revolutionalist, a politician, and many more jobs before he became the President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
            Uncle Ho dedicated 58 years of his life fighting for the dependent of Vietname and finally entered his enternal rest on September 2nd, 1969.
            The life of President Ho Chi Minh is a pure and beautiful life of a great communist, an outstanding national hero, an eminent international soldier, who fought tirelessly and devoted all my life for the Fatherland, for the people, and for ideals.
